# dra-mock

mock up to show potential employer at the time, that I could build something in the technologies they use on a daily basis.
I also created a design mockup in Affinity Designer to show that I can design from the ground up and also build a small website from the ground up in a matter of a few days while learning technologies.  Everything when completed will be built using an apache server, php, html, css, javascript, jquery, a wordpress custom template built by me, and responsive design.
